older then six years. If You made reasnoble effert to find contributors and don't 
find anyone for a given contribution that time limit is lowered to three years. If
the target license is an license alreaddy in the license history of the file the
time is also lowered to three years.

When changing the license the license history need to be preserved, licens history
older then nine Years may be moved to a separate history document distributed with
the file in an obvius place where You expect to find such documents. When
finaly upgrading the license the first version of the software under the new license
must also be distributed under the old license to give anyone who do not like the
change an forking point.
